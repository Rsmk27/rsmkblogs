                <div class="blog-content">
                    <p>While 5G networks are still rolling out globally, engineers and researchers are already defining
                        the specifications for the next generation of wireless technology: 6G. Expected to launch
                        commercially around 2030, 6G promises to be far more than just "faster 5G". It envisions a world
                        of ubiquitous, instant connectivity that merges the physical, digital, and biological worlds.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Speed and Latency</h2>
                    <p>5G offers speeds up to 20 Gbps and latency as low as 1 millisecond. 6G aims to shatter these
                        records, targeting speeds of 1 Tbps (terabit per second)—that's 100 times faster than 5G.
                        Latency could drop to microsecond levels, enabling truly real-time tactile feedback for remote
                        surgery and immersive holographic communication.</p>

                    <h2>Frequencies: Terahertz Waves</h2>
                    <p>To achieve these speeds, 6G will move further up the radio spectrum into the Terahertz (THz)
                        band. These extremely high-frequency waves can carry massive amounts of data but have very short
                        range and are easily blocked by obstacles. This will require new antenna technologies, such as
                        Metamaterial-based surfaces and "intelligent reflecting surfaces" aimed at guiding signals
                        around obstacles.</p>

                    <h2>AI-Native Networks</h2>
                    <p>Unlike previous generations, 6G is being designed with Artificial Intelligence as a native
                        component. The network will self-optimize, predict traffic patterns, and detect anomalies
                        autonomously. AI will manage the complex orchestration of spectrum and resources required to
                        maintain constant, high-speed connectivity for billions of devices.</p>

                    <h2>New Use Cases</h2>
                    <p>6G will enable applications that seem futuristic today:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Holographic Telepresence:</strong> Full 3D, life-size projections effectively
                            replacing video calls.</li>
                        <li><strong>Digital Twins:</strong> Real-time, high-fidelity digital replicas of entire cities
                            or factories for monitoring and simulation.</li>
                        <li><strong>Internet of Senses:</strong> Transmitting taste, smell, and touch sensations
                            digitally.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>The transition to 6G will mark a shift from connecting people and things to connecting
                        intelligence itself. As we move towards 2030, the boundaries of connectivity will expand,
                        fundamentally changing how we interact with technology and each other.</p>
