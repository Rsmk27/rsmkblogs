                    <p>Electrical and Electronics Engineering (EEE) remains one of the most versatile and lucrative
                        degrees in the STEM world. As industry 5.0 takes hold, the demand for specialized engineers is
                        skyrocketing. Based on current market trends and salary data for 2025, here are the top 5 career
                        paths to consider.</p>

                    <h3>1. Machine Learning Engineer (Hardware Focus)</h3>
                    <p><strong>Avg. Salary:</strong> $170,000+</p>
                    <p>Sitting at the intersection of AI and hardware, these engineers design the specialized
                        accelerators (like TPUs and NPUs) that train and run massive neural networks. It requires deep
                        knowledge of both digital logic design and machine learning algorithms.</p>

                    <h3>2. Power Systems Engineer (Renewables)</h3>
                    <p><strong>Avg. Salary:</strong> $110,000 - $140,000</p>
                    <p>With the global push for net-zero, engineers who can design smart grids, integrate solar/wind
                        farms, and manage high-voltage transmission are in incredibly high demand. This role is
                        future-proof and vital for the planet.</p>

                    <h3>3. Embedded Systems Architect</h3>
                    <p><strong>Avg. Salary:</strong> $130,000 - $160,000</p>
                    <p>As the Internet of Things (IoT) matures, we need architects who can design secure, efficient, and
                        robust firmware for everything from smart medical devices to autonomous vehicles. Knowledge of
                        Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS) and cybersecurity is key here.</p>

                    <h3>4. RF & Microwave Engineer</h3>
                    <p><strong>Avg. Salary:</strong> $115,000 - $150,000</p>
                    <p>5G is established, and 6G research is underway. Radio Frequency engineers are the wizards who
                        make wireless communication possible. This highly technical field rewards those with a strong
                        grasp of electromagnetics and signal processing.</p>

                    <h3>5. Electric Vehicle (EV) Powertrain Engineer</h3>
                    <p><strong>Avg. Salary:</strong> $120,000 - $155,000</p>
                    <p>The automotive industry has effectively become a tech industry. Powertrain engineers design the
                        battery management systems (BMS), inverters, and electric motors that drive modern
                        transportation. It's a fast-paced field with tangible results on the road.</p>

                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>The "traditional" electrical engineer is a thing of the past. Today's roles are
                        interdisciplinary, requiring a mix of hardware knowledge, software skills, and domain expertise.
                        Whichever path you choose, the future looks bright (and electric).</p>
