                <div class="blog-content">
                    <p>They are the brains of modern civilization. From the phone in your pocket to the car in your
                        driveway, semiconductors are the invisible engine of the global economy. In 2025, the industry
                        is pushing the boundaries of physics as we approach the "Angstrom Era."</p>

                    <h2>The Current Landscape: 3nm is the New Normal</h2>
                    <p>Leading foundries like TSMC and Samsung have stabilized mass production of 3nm chips. These
                        processors power the latest generation of smartphones and data centers, offering a massive leap
                        in performance-per-watt. But the hunger for AI computing power is driving demand faster than
                        supply can keep up.</p>

                    <h2>The Next Frontier: 2nm and GAAFETs</h2>
                    <p>The industry is currently transitioning to the 2nm process node (N2), utilizing a new transistor
                        architecture known as <strong>Gate-All-Around (GAA)</strong> FETs. Unlike the FinFETs of the
                        past decade, GAA transistors stack nanosheets vertically, allowing for better control over
                        current flow and reduced leakage. This is crucial for maintaining energy efficiency as we cram
                        billions more transistors onto a single die.</p>

                    <h2>Advanced Packaging: More Than Just Shrinking</h2>
                    <p>With Moore's Law slowing down in terms of raw density, <strong>Advanced Packaging</strong> has
                        become the new innovation vector. Technologies like "Chiplets" and 3D stacking allow engineers
                        to mix and match different types of silicon (memory, logic, I/O) into a single package. This is
                        the secret sauce behind the massive AI accelerators driving the current generative AI boom.</p>

                    <h2>Strategic Sovereignty</h2>
                    <p>The "Chip Shortage" of the early 2020s taught the world a hard lesson. Today, nations are racing
                        to build domestic fabrication capacity. The US CHIPS Act and similar initiatives in Europe and
                        Japan are beginning to bear fruit, with new "Mega-Fabs" coming online in 2025, aiming to
                        rebalance the global supply chain and secure the future of computing.</p>
